            <p>This app demonstrates how to use Gitcoin Passport's onchain stamps.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In the <b>About onchain Stamps</b> tab you will find resources to help you understand onchain Stamps.</p>
            <br />
            <p>You can also connect your wallet to check whether you have onchain Stamps</p>
            <br />
            <li>Connect your wallet by clicking "Connect"</li>
            <li>Allow the app to query your Passport by clicking "Query Passport"</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <b>Are your Stamps onchain?</b> tab to see whether you have onchain Stamps</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <b>Browse your Stamps</b> tab to see which Stamps you own onchain!</li>
            <br />
            <p>This is just an example app to demonstrate how onchain stamps can be built into your own project.</p>

            <p><b>Onchain Stamps are available to smart contracts!</b></p>
            <br />
            <p>Onchain Stamps are created using web3 primitives, meaning you are never reliant upon Gitoin's servers for access to your data. Your apps are only available to smart contract applications when they are onchain.</p>
            <br />
            <p>You can migrate your Stamps onchain any time using the Passport app.</p>
            <br />
            <p>This app is a demonstration of how onchain Stamps can be queried and used to gate content by app developers.</p>
            <p>In the background, this app is loading the relevant contracts, querying your address to check for Stamps, retrieving and decoding them.</p>
            <br />
            <p>If you have Stamps, then you will see a message of congratulations and a nice solarpunk image in the next tab. You will also be able to see your Stamps in the final tab.</p>
            <br />
            <p>However, if you do not have onchain Stamps, instead of the congratulatory message you will be instructed how to migrate onchain using the Passport app.</p>
